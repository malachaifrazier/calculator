# Calculator

This is my terrible Calculator example...I'm not sure why I created a gem for it :-/

## Usage

Start the program from the command line like so:
```ruby
ruby bin/calculator
```

Run the spec suite from the command line like so:
```ruby
bundle exec rake spec
```

## Contributing

2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)
5. Create a new Pull Request
